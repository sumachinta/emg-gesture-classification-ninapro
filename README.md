# NinaPro DB2 EMG Gesture Classification

This repository implements an end-to-end machine learning and deep learning pipeline for decoding **hand and finger gestures from surface EMG (sEMG)** signals using the **NinaPro DB2 dataset**.

The goal of this project is to reproduce and extend classical EMG decoding workflows ‚Äî from preprocessing and feature extraction to deep neural network classifiers ‚Äî and benchmark them on gesture recognition accuracy.

## üß† Project Overview

Electromyography (EMG) captures the electrical activity produced by skeletal muscles.  
In this project, we use multi-channel EMG signals to **classify hand gestures** in the NinaPro DB2 dataset.

We develop two complementary decoding pipelines:

| Pipeline | Approach | Description |
|-----------|-----------|--------------|
| **Classical ML** | Feature-based | RMS, MAV, WL, ZC, SSC + LDA/SVM |
| **Deep Learning** | End-to-end | 1D-CNN / ShallowFBCSPNet / EEGNet-style models |

## üìÇ Dataset ‚Äî NinaPro DB2

**Source:** [NinaPro (Non-Invasive Adaptive Prosthetics)](https://ninapro.hevs.ch/)  
**Dataset:** *DB2 ‚Äì 40 subjects performing 49 hand movements*  
**Sensors:** 12-channel Delsys Trigno sEMG  
**Sampling rate:** 2 kHz  
**Duration:** ~6 seconds per repetition, 6 repetitions per gesture  

**Gesture classes include:**
- Individual finger flexions
- Combined hand grasps (spherical, lateral, cylindrical)
- Wrist and finger movements
- Rest state (T0)

Data files are distributed as `.mat` (MATLAB) files per subject.
